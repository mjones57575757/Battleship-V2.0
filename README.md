## About the Game

Battleship is a game that can be played offline (if you download the code) 

The reason I named it "Battleship" was because the player has a special flame attack that can only be used so many times.

Grab a pair of gaming headphones, get your keyboard ready, and get your gaming skills up and running.  Get ready to play my best game.

## How I built it

I wrote down a checklist of what I would do then I searched the internet for all the things I would need to do, and planned really hard before the release.  That's why I was able to do this.

## How to Play

Game controls are in the game, but I'll post the instructions here anyways.

### When loading the game enter: start, to start the game or enter: help, to get information of what to do in the game. from there enter a number 0, 9 (there are 2 excess sets of tiles but they don't work.

## Warnings
 - This game is very good for all people who like the game of battleship
 - This game may break due to the tiles on certin devices
